<p>As you have visited my profile, I would like to reccomend you my big_projects repository to look at, which includes a monopoly
  dice simulation, the monopoly game in python, and artificial intelligence based models. One of them takes a look into a projection
  by the model that the US would begin to increase tariffs in the 1980s(that didn't happen). I now treat that model like a possible
  alternate history as it could of happend. I have been working on a new model that is better at predicting what will happen in 
  the future of the United States of America, which I will discuss in the next paragraph.</p>

<p>In my cliodynamics repository, I have a directory dedicated to America and a statistical analysis in order to get a better
picture of what has been going on in the US. I mean, the only things I used to remember was the first years of the country,
the civil war, and the post Great Depression era. However, this statistical analysis has deepened my understanding of
American history. I also use this statistical analysis to see what could happen in the future(sorry, the crystal ball hasn't
been invented yet). I have a prediction where the US goes through a recession, and a stronger predictino that the US goes 
through a civil war. I'll let you explore from here on out.</p>
