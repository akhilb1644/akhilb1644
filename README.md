<p>As you have visited my profile, I would like to reccomend you my big_projects repository to look at, which includes a monopoly
  dice simulation, the monopoly game in python, and artificial intelligence based models. One of them takes a look into a projection
  by the model that the US would begin to increase tariffs in the 1980s(that didn't happen). I now treat that model like a possible
  alternate history as it could of happend. I am currently working on a new model that is better at predicting what will happen in 
  the future of the United States of America.</p>
